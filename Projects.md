  - 求efine Problem: Building a data model and creating a physical relational database. Loading data into the database and performing SQL queries using MySQL for data preparation and data exploratory.
 
  - Data Collection: Datasets are available on Kaggle. Datasets contains 1000 rows and 15 columns of the supermarket performance from 3 cites in Q1 of 2019.

  - Data Preparation: Data format is correctly identifying in the data model and no missing values or duplicate rows.

  - Data Exploratory: Sales Analysis, Customer Behavior Analysis and Product Analysis.

  - 求efine Problem: Taproot Foundation connects nonprofits and social change organizations with passionate business professionals who share their expertise pro bono. Data is used to evaluate the results of projects to identify the outcomes, match rates, duration of projects and other relevant statistics. For example, identifying a project type that is chronically underperforming or under matched compared to other project types could signify a need to broaden the pool of volunteer talent in that area. 
 
  - Data Collection: Dataset is collected from Taproot's terradata files.

  - Data Preparation: Data is already fairly well structured but required some manipulation to get the necessary format for the project.

  - Data Exploratory: Insights are most pertinent to the organization when deciding where to focus potential volunteer efforts.
    - Percentage of volunteer inquiries that failed to be selected
      
    - Percentage of projects that succeeded
      
    - Average days to project completion (could be due to cancellation or actual matching and completion of project)
    - Average days to volunteer match to project
      
    - Number of volunteer inquiries by project type

  - 求efine Problem: The dataset is obtained from Instacart, an electronic commerce grocery ordering and delivery organization. The dataset contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. The dataset contains details about the orders placed by various users, the sequence of products purchased in each order, the week and hour of day the order was placed, and a relative measure of time between orders. It also has information about the aisle and department for the sold products.
