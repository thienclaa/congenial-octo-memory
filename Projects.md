  -  Define Problem: Taproot Foundation connects nonprofits and social change organizations with passionate business professionals who share their expertise pro bono. Dataset was used to evaluate the results of nonprofit projects to identify the outcomes, the match rates and the duration of projects as well as other relevant statistics.
 
  - Data Collection: Datasets are collected from Taproot's terradata files. I will be using 4 different datasets for the project.

  - Data Preparation: Data was already fairly well structured but required some manipulation to get the necessary format for the project.

  - Data Exploratory: The questions were most pertinent to the organization when deciding where to focus potential volunteer efforts. For example, identifying a project type that is chronically underperforming or under matched compared to other project types could signify a need to broaden the pool of volunteer talent in that area. 
    - Which project types produce the best outcomes in the survey data?
    - Which project types perform better on the platform? Match rate, days to match, number of inquiries received.
    - Which project types take the longest to complete?
    - Which project types take the shortest to complete?
      
  - Communication of insights: Power BI
