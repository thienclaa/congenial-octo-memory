### [Descriptive Analytics - Superstore Sales](https://github.com/thienclaa/congenial-octo-projects/tree/main/SQL/Superstore%20Sales%20Analysis)

  -  Define Problem: Taproot Foundation connects nonprofits and social change organizations with passionate professionals who share their expertise pro bono. Data is used to evaluate the results of projects to identify the outcomes, match rates, duration of projects and other relevant statistics. For example, identifying a project type that is chronically underperforming or under matched compared to other project types could signify a need to broaden the pool of volunteer talent in that area. 
 
  - Data Collection: Dataset is collected from Taproot's terradata files.

  - Data Preparation: Data is already fairly well structured but required some manipulation to get the necessary format for the project.

  - Data Exploratory: Insights are most pertinent to the organization when deciding where to focus potential volunteer efforts.
    - Percentage of volunteer inquiries that failed to be selected
    - Percentage of projects that succeeded
    - Average days to project completion (could be due to cancellation or actual matching and completion of project)
    - Average days to volunteer match to project
    - Number of volunteer inquiries by project type
